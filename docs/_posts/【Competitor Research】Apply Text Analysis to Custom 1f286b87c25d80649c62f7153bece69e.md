### **What I did**

- First, using both Scraper and API to get an overview of the market (Tripadvisor & Google Maps)
- Second, get a selective restaurants list and extract customer reviews of them

- Then, using method of “Text Analysis” to identify and extract key dimensions and put them into relevant catagories, and then using “Word Cloud” to deliver the insights for stakeholders.
- Lastly, working together with the brand owner to make a launch plan for opening.
