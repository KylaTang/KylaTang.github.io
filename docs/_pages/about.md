Hi, this is Min! I'm a **Product Marketer** with a passion for bridging the gap between product teams and real-world users, and for crafting effective go-to-market strategies.

Welcome connect on [LINKEDIN](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kylatang)!


I am always interested in human behaviors, try to know about those patterns and reasons behind that. That leads me to the way of marketing — how people’s behaviors will change when they receive different stimulation, which can be from peers, social status, self-values(and it always relates a lot to their environment too), advertisement ect. 

I have been worked in tech-product’s marketing for 8+ years, and responsible diverse markets globally, from China, Korea, Vietnam, Finland, Poland, UK, NL and so on. Luckily, I have been worked with leading companies in this area, SONY, TCL, HONOR, and BASF, so that I have numerous experience of international projects, from **new** **product launch, campaigns to market expansion and customer growth**.


These experience has shaped me intuition of understanding user needs and bring them back to product development team.And in the digital and data era, user behaviors will no more be red as the same as traditional way. Thus I decided to dive in data.

Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree to deepen my data analytical skills in Sweden and already finished my first year of intense study. You can find my analysis cases in my webpage:) For the next step, I would love to tangle them with the real world, because real world usually tell a greater story of human. 

Outside of work, I'm curious about exploring new things and taking challenges, so I also like photography and storytelling stuff.

If you’re interested in marketing, tech, photography—or just want to connect—I'd love to hear from you!
